There are so many thrust vector controlled model rocket projects out there, but none of them are open source. This project aims to change that. This project is open source and is meant to be a resource for anyone who wants to build a thrust vector controlled model rocket. This project is also meant to be a resource for anyone who wants to learn about thrust vector control.

Here's why I decided to make this project:
* Wanted to explore the world of control algorithms
* Real-time control algorithms are soo cool
* I love to learn :)

### Built With
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
* [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)
* [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) (yes I have switched to KiCAD)

### Building the flight software in PlatformIO
1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daniel360kim/NACE-TVC-V1.git
    ```
3. Open the project in PlatformIO
4. Build the project

See? Super-duper easy with PlatformIO. It will also automatically install all the dependencies for you!
